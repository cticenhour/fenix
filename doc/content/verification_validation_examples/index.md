Verification, validation, and example cases list cases showcasing FENIX's capabilities and ensuring its accuracy.

For [software quality assurance](content/sqa/index.md) purposes, FENIX undergoes verification and validation.
Verification consists of comparing FENIX predictions against analytical solutions in different conditions, which are often simple cases.
Validation consists of comparing FENIX predictions against experimental data.

Note that in addition to monitoring FENIX performance and reproducibility in verification and validation cases, the effects of changes made to FENIX are tracked. A series of automated tests are performed via continuous integration using [CIVET](https://civet.inl.gov/repo/1108) to help identify any changes in FENIX's predictions, therefore ensuring stability and robustness.

Benchmarking cases compare FENIX predictions against other codes. Example cases showcase existing FENIX capabilities and demonstrate potential applications.

In all cases, the existing input files should allow users to leverage prior work.

Finally, for more references of FENIX usage, a list of publications supporting FENIX development can be found [here](publications.md).

Note that codes couples with FENIX, such as [TMAP8](https://mooseframework.inl.gov/tmap8), have their own [Verification and Validation page](https://mooseframework.inl.gov/tmap8/verification_and_validation).
